# gae-microservices-template
Cheapskate google cloud app engine microservices template. Intended to be a simple repo to manage.


Had difficulties getting golang to play nice with the folder structure. Any and all suggestions are welcome.


### Requirements

* google app engine enabled
* google app engine api for cloud build
* default cloud build instance has app engine deployer permissions

Make sure the google app engine api is enabled for your current project.

See more details at my blog.
